------------------------------------------- Redux ------------------------------------

predictable state container for JS applications -
keep the data and the views seperate they combine to make a fully working app
redux is the wrapper for the data whilst react is the wrapper for the view layer
centralise all the apps data into a central single object which is reffered to as the state this is managed by redux. application level state is redux.
on a counter redux keeps track of current count where as react creates the video for the counter add button remove button.

most important part is how to design your state in terms of thinking how to model the state

CONTAINER: is a react component that has a direct connection to the state managed by redux its the bridge between the views and redux. Most parent component should be container but be careful as sometimes app doesn't care about the state sometimes. Only create containers out of particular components that care about a particular bit of state.The most parent component should be connected to redux its using a plugin called React-redux to act as the bridge. When you link a component to redux it becomes a container. 

------------------------------------------- Reducer ------------------------------------

A reducer is a function that returns a piece of the applications state because the app can have many states we can have loads of reducers. Books and active books would be two reducers. They are smart components

All reducers get two arguments acess to state and action. They are only ever called when action occurs.

state argument is not application state, only the state that this reducers is responsible for.

most reducers use switch statements to manage state

never mutate state or return 100% clean state

reducers boot up on inital app load and pass some default actions through them
------------------------------------------- Action creaters ------------------------------------

Actions and action creaters help us change / manage state. Action creaters are function that returns an action / object which is sent to all reducers in your app. Reducers can choose dpending on action to return a different piece of state. That new state gets piped in app state then app state gets pumped into react app which re renders all components

UserAction > calls action creater > action creater returns obkect > actin auto sent to all reducers > reducers process action and return state > pass state to new container > re render app
