import React, {Component} from 'react'; // import react and pull of component and store in const component

/* every component that is classed based needs to have a render method that returns JSX

--------------- Events ---------------

handling events in react has 2 steps
declare event handler function ran when event occurs
pass the event handler to the element that we want to monitor for events know when input ele inside search bar has text changed

onChange is a prop or property access to the change event react specific
value is a prop or property access that sets the value
---------------------------------------------

--------------- State ------------------------------

is a plain JS object that is used to record and react to a user's event. Each class based component has it's own state object.When a component changes the render function runs and the state changes. This forces it children to re render. you need to initialize state to begin inside of the class constructor function. All js classes have a constructor function. Its the first function called automatically when you create a new instance of that class. The constructor function is reserved for setup initialize variables and state.

create new object and assign this.state we assign key and value pairs that we want to record on the state.

class based components only get access to state each instance. define constructor method and setting the state.

Controlled field is a form element whose value is set by the state value only ever changes when state changes

 this.setState allows you to pass new objects to this.state which then triggers a re render input tell the state to change

functional components don't have access to state
functional components can take in class based components in the JSX

---------------------------------------------

--------------- Downwards data flow ------------------------------

only the most parent component in the application should be responsible for fetching data index is the most parent so app is the root
