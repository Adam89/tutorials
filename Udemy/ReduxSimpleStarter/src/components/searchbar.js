import React, {Component} from 'react'; // import react and pull of component and store in const component

/* every component that is classed based needs to have a render method that returns JSX

--------------- Events ---------------

handling events in react has 2 steps
declare event handler
pass the event handler to the element that we want to monitor for events

onChange is a prop or property access to the change event react specific
value is a prop or property access that sets the value
---------------------------------------------

--------------- State ------------------------------

is a plain JS object that is used to record and react to a user's event. Each class based component has it's own state object.When a component changes the render function runs and the state changes.

Controlled field is a form element whose value is set by the state value only ever changes when state changes

functional components don't have access to state
functional components can take in class based components in the JSX

---------------------------------------------

--------------- Downwards data flow ------------------------------

only the most parent component in the application should be responsible for fetching data

------------------------------------------------------------
