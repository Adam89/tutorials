//v- just tells vue that this is not a normal html attribute its a directive it should handle
//you can register a custom directive globally the first arg is the selector name of directive without v-minus next is the object that configures the directive

//directive has 5 hooks to peform things with the element

// bind hook: this is fired once the directive is attached 3 args el it sits on,  binding argument the way it is set up args or modifies we pass to it , and v-node references to the virtual node you will rarely use this binding and v-node should be treated as read only

// inserted hook: this occurs as soon as it inserted in the dom but can be from the first hook doesn't need to inserted into the dom same args as above

// update: is called when component is updated but children haven't updated same args as above plus oldVnode we get new node and old node both should be treated as read only

// component updated: same args is update when component and children has been updated

// unbind: once directive has been removed same args as bind

// you will use bind and update the most often the bind node triggering what the directive triggers when applied to an element

// global directive above shows you how to use arguments modifiers and values such as color

// local directives are only available on one component

//you can also have multiple modifiers

// you can pass in objects as values too and acess them by using binding.value.WHATEVER YOUR OBJECT KEY IS vue js doesn't care what the value is
